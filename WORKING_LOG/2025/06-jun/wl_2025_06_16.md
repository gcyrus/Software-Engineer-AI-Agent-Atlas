## Modern API Service Layer Implementation - Phase 1.1 Complete

### Time: 23:41 UTC

Implemented the Modern API Service Layer for CardForge integration as specified in Phase 1.1 of the CARDFORGE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md.

### Work Completed:

1. **Created API Configuration** (`src/config/api.config.ts`)
   - Environment-based configuration with VITE_API_URL support
   - Comprehensive endpoint definitions for all API routes
   - Retry configuration with exponential backoff
   - Separate timeout settings for regular requests and file uploads

2. **Created TypeScript Interfaces** (`src/types/api.ts`)
   - Complete type definitions for all API models
   - Proper enum types for JobStatus, OutputFormat, ProfileType
   - Interface for file upload progress tracking
   - Custom ApiError class for structured error handling
   - WebSocket message types for real-time updates

3. **Created Main API Service** (`src/services/api.ts`)
   - Axios client with request/response interceptors
   - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Automatic retry logic for failed requests
   - File upload support with progress tracking
   - Organized API methods by resource type (character, profile, job, system)

4. **Created WebSocket Service** (`src/services/websocket.ts`)
   - Real-time job updates via WebSocket
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Event-based architecture for job subscriptions
   - Connection state management

5. **Created React Query Hooks** (`src/hooks/use-api.ts`)
   - Type-safe hooks for all API operations
   - Integrated WebSocket updates with React Query cache
   - Upload progress tracking in mutations
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Query key factory for consistent cache management

6. **Additional Files Created**:
   - Index files for barrel exports (services, types, config)
   - `.env.example` with required environment variables
   - `api.example.tsx` with comprehensive usage examples
   - `README.md` documenting the API service layer

### Quality Standards Met:

- ✅ TypeScript with minimal `any` types (zero any types used)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Modern dependencies (Axios latest stable version)
- ✅ Proper timeout and retry logic
- ✅ Upload progress tracking implemented
- ✅ WebSocket support for real-time updates
- ✅ React Query integration for optimal caching
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Development logging for debugging

### Technical Details:

- Used Axios for HTTP client (installed via npm)
- Leveraged existing @tanstack/react-query dependency
- Followed existing project patterns (@/ import alias, shadcn/ui components)
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- All files follow the project's code style

### Next Steps:

Phase 1.1 is now complete. The API service layer is ready for integration with the existing CardForge components. The next phases would involve:
- Phase 1.2: Enhanced Character Generation Form
- Phase 1.3: Intelligent Profile Management
- Phase 1.4: Real-time Job Monitoring

The foundation is solid and production-ready for building the remaining features.
