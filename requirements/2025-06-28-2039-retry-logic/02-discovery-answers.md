**Answered by:** Grant

## Q1: Will this retry logic need to handle rate limiting (HTTP 429) responses from OpenRouter?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q2: Should the retry logic apply to ALL async operations in character_book_updater.py (including topic analysis, entry generation, and updates)?
**Answer:** Yes
**Context:** The retry logic should be applied before falling back to the simplified fallback entries, improving quality by reducing how often we resort to fallback options.

## Q3: Will users be able to configure retry parameters (max attempts, delays) through the existing configuration system?
**Answer:** Yes

## Q4: Should retry attempts be visible in the job progress updates sent via WebSocket?
**Answer:** No (WebSockets not implemented yet)
**Context:** WebSocket functionality will be handled in a future implementation phase.

## Q5: Do we need to distinguish between different types of failures (network vs API errors) for retry behavior?
**Answer:** No (static backoff is fine)
**Context:** A simple static backoff strategy will be sufficient for all error types.
