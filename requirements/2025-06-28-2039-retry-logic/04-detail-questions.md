# Expert Requirements Questions - Retry Logic Implementation

## Q6: Should the async retry utility be added to the existing error_handler.py module alongside robust_operation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (keeps retry logic centralized with other error handling utilities)

## Q7: Should retry configuration be loaded from the main config dict under a "retry_config" key at the CharacterBookUpdater initialization?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (follows existing pattern where all config is loaded in __init__ method)

## Q8: Should retry attempts log at INFO level while final failures log at ERROR level with full stack traces?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides good operational visibility without cluttering logs during normal retries)

## Q9: Should the retry logic preserve the original exception and re-raise it after all attempts fail?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains existing error handling behavior where callers can catch specific exception types)

## Q10: Should we add retry-specific metrics to the debug_manager output when debug mode is enabled?
**Default if unknown:** No (retry logic is an implementation detail, not needed in debug reports for character generation)
