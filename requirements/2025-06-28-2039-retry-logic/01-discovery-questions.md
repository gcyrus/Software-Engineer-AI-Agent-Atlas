# Discovery Questions - Retry Logic Implementation

## Q1: Will this retry logic need to handle rate limiting (HTTP 429) responses from OpenRouter?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (OpenRouter APIs commonly implement rate limiting, and the code already handles 429 status codes)

## Q2: Should the retry logic apply to ALL async operations in character_book_updater.py (including topic analysis, entry generation, and updates)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (comprehensive retry coverage ensures robustness for all AI generation tasks)

## Q3: Will users be able to configure retry parameters (max attempts, delays) through the existing configuration system?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the codebase already has extensive configuration support through config files)

## Q4: Should retry attempts be visible in the job progress updates sent via WebSocket?
**Default if unknown:** No (retry attempts are typically implementation details not exposed to users)

## Q5: Do we need to distinguish between different types of failures (network vs API errors) for retry behavior?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (different error types often require different retry strategies - e.g., immediate retry for network vs backoff for rate limits)
